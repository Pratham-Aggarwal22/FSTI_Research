# USA Map Transit Metrics Information

## Percent Access (Initial walk distance < 4 miles, Initial wait time <60 minutes)
USA Map average values 

## Transit: Driving
This metric compares transit travel time to driving time. Values closer to 1.0 indicate transit is competitive with driving, while higher values suggest transit takes significantly longer than driving.

## Initial Wait Time in Minutes
The average time passengers wait for their first transit vehicle. Lower values indicate better service frequency and reduced waiting times.

## Initial Walk Distance in Miles
The average distance passengers walk to reach their first transit stop. Shorter distances indicate better transit coverage and accessibility.

## Initial Walk Duration in Minutes
The average time spent walking to reach the first transit stop. Shorter durations indicate better transit accessibility and coverage.

## Total Wait Duration in Minutes
The total time spent waiting for transit vehicles throughout the entire journey. Lower values indicate more efficient transit service.

## Total Walk Distance in Miles
The total distance walked throughout the entire transit journey. Shorter distances indicate better transit connectivity and fewer transfers.

## Total Walk Duration in minutes
The total time spent walking throughout the entire transit journey. Shorter durations indicate better transit connectivity and accessibility.

## Transfers
The average number of transfers required to complete a transit journey. Fewer transfers indicate better route planning and connectivity.

## In-Vehicle Duration in Minutes
The total time spent inside transit vehicles during the journey. This metric helps assess the efficiency of transit routes.

## Out-of-Vehicle Duration in Minutes
The total time spent outside vehicles (walking, waiting, transferring) during the journey. Lower values indicate better transit efficiency.

## In-Vehicle:Out-of-Vehicle
The ratio of time spent in vehicles to time spent outside vehicles. Higher ratios indicate more efficient transit service with less waiting and walking time.

## Travel Duration in Minutes
The total time required to complete the transit journey from origin to destination. Shorter durations indicate more efficient transit service.

## Driving Duration with Traffic in Minutes
The time required to drive the same route during typical traffic conditions. This metric helps compare transit efficiency to driving.

## Sample Size
The number of transit routes or trips analyzed for each geographic area. Larger sample sizes provide more reliable and representative data.
