# Frequency Distribution Metrics Information

## Travel Duration in Minutes
Frequency charts for state maps

## Initial Walk Duration in Minutes
This chart displays the distribution of initial walking durations before boarding transit. It shows how long people typically walk to reach their first transit stop. This metric is crucial for understanding accessibility to public transportation.

## Transit to Driving Ratio
This chart illustrates the ratio between transit travel time and driving time. Values closer to 1 indicate similar travel times, while higher values suggest transit takes longer than driving. This helps assess the competitiveness of public transit.

## Transfers
This chart shows the distribution of transfer counts during transit journeys. It helps understand the complexity of transit routes and the number of connections required. Fewer transfers generally indicate more direct and convenient routes.

## Initial Walk Distance in Miles
This chart displays the distribution of initial walking distances to reach transit stops. It shows how far people typically walk to access public transportation. This metric is important for assessing the walkability of transit systems.

## Initial Wait Time in Minutes
This chart shows the distribution of waiting times at the first transit stop. It indicates how long passengers typically wait for their initial transit connection. Shorter wait times generally indicate better service frequency.

## Out-Of-Vehicle Duration In Minutes
This chart displays the distribution of time spent outside of vehicles during transit journeys, including walking and waiting times. This represents the non-riding portion of the total journey time.

## In-Vehicle Duration in Minutes
This chart shows the distribution of time spent inside transit vehicles during journeys. It represents the actual riding time on buses, trains, or other transit modes. This is the core travel time component.

## Total Walk Duration in Minutes
This chart displays the distribution of total walking time throughout the entire journey, including initial and transfer walks. This metric helps assess the pedestrian accessibility of the transit system.

## Total Walk Distance in Miles
This chart shows the distribution of total walking distance for complete transit journeys, including all walking segments. This helps evaluate the walkability and accessibility of the transit network.

## In-Vehicle To Out-Of-Vehicle Ratio
This chart illustrates the ratio between time spent in vehicles versus time spent walking and waiting. It helps understand the efficiency of transit journeys. Higher ratios indicate more time spent riding relative to walking/waiting.

## Total Wait Duration In Minutes
This chart displays the distribution of total waiting time across all transit stops during a journey, including initial and transfer waits. This metric helps assess the efficiency of transit scheduling and connections.
