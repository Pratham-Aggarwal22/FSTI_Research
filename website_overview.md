# Website Overview

## Introduction
The website is a comprehensive platform for visualizing and analyzing public transit accessibility and social equity across the United States. It transforms millions of raw data points into interactive maps, charts, and actionable insights for researchers, policymakers, and the public.

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Maps
*   **State & County Views:** Users can explore transit metrics (like Wait Time, Access %) at a high-level state view or drill down into individual counties.
*   **Choropleth Visualization:** Areas are color-coded based on metric performance, making geographic disparities immediately visible.

### 2. Statistical Comparison Tool
*   **Scatter Plots:** Compare the distribution of transit quality across multiple states simultaneously.
*   **Metric Filtering:** Users can mix and match metrics from different categories (Transit vs. Equity) to uncover hidden trends.

### 3. Cluster Analysis (Equity vs. Transit)
*   **K-Means Clustering:** An advanced analytical tool that automatically segments areas into four distinct profiles (Synergy, Critical, Service Gap, High Access) based on the intersection of social need and transit supply.

### 4. AI Chatbot Assistant
*   **Natural Language Query:** A built-in AI assistant that allows users to ask questions about the data in plain English, bypassing the need for complex manual filtering or data export.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
*   **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Used for server-side templating to render dynamic HTML pages.
*   **Chart.js:** A powerful library used for rendering the scatter plots, dot plots, and statistical charts.
*   **CSS3:** Custom styling for a modern, responsive user interface.

### Backend
*   **Node.js & Express:** The core server framework handling API requests, routing, and application logic.
*   **MongoDB:** The primary database storing the massive dataset of transit and equity metrics. It uses a flexible schema to handle the diverse data structures of Census and Transit data.
*   **OpenAI API:** Powers the Chatbot's intelligence (`gpt-4o`) for planning and response generation.
*   **Python Integration:** Used in the background for heavy data processing and executing logic generated by the chatbot.

### Data Infrastructure
*   **Google Maps APIs:** Used during the data collection phase for Geocoding, Places, and Directions (as detailed in the Methodology).
*   **Census Data:** Integrated datasets for Equity metrics (Employment, Income, Race, Housing).
